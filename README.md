# Manifesto: automated political text analysis

A project for political education based on simple machine learning applied to texts of political manifestos, annotated by the political scientists of the [Manifesto Project](https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/). 

The idea is to use the high-quality (but relatively low volume) manifesto project data annotated by human experts in order to train a text-classification model that can be used to extrapolate the experts' annotations to larger text corpora such as news articles. The hope is to support political education. 

This code is partially based on an [earlier project](https://github.com/kirel/political-affiliation-prediction), which learned a similar text classification model on speeches in the German Parliament. 

A preliminary [demo can be found here](http://fipi-dev.elasticbeanstalk.com/).

## Local setup in virtualenv

Install [virtualenvwrapper)](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 
In the folder containing the directory cloned from github then type:

    mkvirtualenv -a manifesto manifesto

Go to the `web` folder and install the dependencies with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the webserver with 
    
    python api.py

Open a browser window and navigate to localhost:5000. 

## Local setup with Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and start it. 
In the project root folder then build the docker image and start it with:

    docker-compose up

Open a browser window and navigate to [IP-of-docker-container]:5000.

## Deploy with AWS Elasticbeanstalk

Install EB CLI
    
    pip install awsebcli

Create and deploy app, then open it

    eb init
    eb create
    eb open
